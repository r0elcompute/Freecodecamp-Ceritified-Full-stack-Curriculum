        <p class="text">A kenyan boy named Francis Githau hit the newsline when he came up with his very own robotic prosthetic arm. <br>
        He is a 14 year old grade six student at the Kidzone Tango school in a small neighbourhood in Mombasa, Nyali.<br>
    People were amazed by his innovation and even wondered how a young child could have <br> the skillset to come up with such a complex piece of device that not everyone is capable of building. <br>
    This drew closer the attention of tech companies across Kenya and Africa at large, with CEO s asking for the whereabout of the young man.</p>
        <p class="text">In a recent headline, Francis opened up about receiving a scholarship and contract to work with ipoa Kenya to make sure his dream <br>
        becomes a reality for many disabled people across Africa and even the world at large! Pretty amazing right?</p>
